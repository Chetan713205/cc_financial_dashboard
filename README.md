**Note: Credit Card Transaction and Customer Report**

I have created a comprehensive **Credit Card Transaction and Customer Report** using Power BI. The CSV datasets were first uploaded into SQL, and then imported into Power BI for analysis. Upon project completion, new datasets were added to SQL, and the dashboard was refreshed to ensure the data is up to date.

Various DAX queries were employed to uncover hidden insights. I aimed to maintain a clean and simple layout with charts that clearly convey the findings. Additionally, a detailed explanation of the project is provided in the attached **summary_report.pdf** file.
